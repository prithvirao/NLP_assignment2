# Assignment 2

For this assignment, we have used n-gram models trained on brown corpus for spell correction on Birkbeck spell error corpus.

## Setup

To setup the environment, run the below line of code to install the required libraries and packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structure

All the functions have been added to the `custom_utils` folder and the `Data` folder contains two datasets APPLING1DAT.643 and a smaller version for sample run.
Once you have setup the environment, you can start executing the notebook `Assignment 2-2.ipynb`
